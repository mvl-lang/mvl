# ADR-0017: Linter Hint Severity — Explicit IFC Annotations as the Preferred Style

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Issues:** #404

---

## Context

The MVL linter has two severity levels: `Warning` and `Error`. The `redundant-ifc-label` rule
was introduced to flag explicit `Public[T]` type annotations as redundant because unannotated
types are implicitly public in MVL's information-flow type system.

When resolving lint warnings in the corpus (#404), it became clear that blanket removal of
`Public[T]` annotations is wrong in IFC-focused code. In files like `declassification.mvl`,
`lattice.mvl`, and `propagation.mvl`, the explicit `Public[T]` annotation is not noise — it
is the point of the code. `fn declassify_token(secret: Secret[Token]) -> Public[Token]`
communicates the security lattice transition explicitly; stripping it to `-> Token` loses
the intent.

Additionally, MVL is a language designed to be **generated**, not primarily hand-written.
Generated code benefits from maximally explicit annotations: every type, every label, every
effect spelled out. Implicit defaults are convenient for humans writing by hand; they are
opaque to toolchains reading and transforming code.

The tension: the linter rule is technically correct (semantics are unchanged), but it
optimises for terseness over explicitness — the wrong default for a generated language.

## Decision

### 1. Add a `Hint` severity level to the linter

Extend `errors::Severity` with a third variant below `Warning`:

```
Hint < Warning < Error
```

- `Hint` — stylistic observations; valid alternatives exist; neither is wrong.
  The linter reports them (visible in output) but they do not count toward
  the warning total and do not fail `make mvl-lint`.
- `Warning` — something is likely wrong or should be changed before shipping.
- `Error` — must be fixed; blocks the build.

`LintResult::warning_count()` counts only `Warning` and above.
`LintResult::is_ok()` is unaffected by hints.

### 2. Downgrade `redundant-ifc-label` from `Warning` to `Hint`

The rule stays enabled by default but no longer fails the lint gate. Its message is
updated to reflect the recommendation framing:

> `Public<T>` is explicit — unannotated types are implicitly public.
> Consider dropping the label in non-IFC-focused code.

### 3. Establish the explicit-annotation principle in corpus style

IFC corpus files (`06_ifc/`, security-labelled fields in structs and function signatures)
**should** retain explicit `Public[T]` annotations. This makes the security lattice visible
to readers, generators, and analysis tools without requiring them to know the implicit
default rule.

Non-IFC corpus files (basic type demos, LLVM tests, etc.) **may** drop `Public[T]` if it
appears as incidental noise rather than deliberate annotation.

---

## Consequences

- `make mvl-lint` no longer fails on `redundant-ifc-label` findings; they appear in the
  output as `hint:` lines but the exit code is clean.
- All IFC corpus files revert to explicit `Public[T]` annotations.
- The linter output gains a third prefix: `hint:` alongside `warning:` and `error:`.
- `LintResult` gains a `hint_count()` method for tests and CI reporting.
- Future rules that are style preferences rather than correctness concerns should default
  to `Hint` severity (e.g., `unnecessary-annotation` for generated code contexts).

---

## Rejected Alternatives

**Suppression pragmas** (`// lint:allow(redundant-ifc-label)`) — adds noise at the use site
and requires every IFC file to opt out individually. Rejected: the rule framing was wrong,
not the corpus files.

**Remove the rule entirely** — loses the signal for hand-written code where `Public[T]` on
a plain integer parameter genuinely is redundant noise. Rejected: the rule has value, just
at the wrong severity.

**Keep `Warning`, update corpus** — removes explicit security annotations from IFC
demonstration files, making them less useful as teaching material and for code generation
pipelines. Rejected.

## Amendment: `missing-annotation` rule (#428)

**Added in:** v0.71.0 (#428)

The `missing-annotation` rule is the directional inverse of `redundant-ifc-label`: where
that rule hints when explicit `Public[T]` annotations are present (redundant but preferred),
`missing-annotation` warns when effect annotations are *absent* on functions that make calls.

This aligns with ADR-0017's stated principle — "explicit annotations are never wrong; they
are the preferred default" — applied to the effect dimension rather than the IFC dimension.

The rule is **disabled by default** (`missing_annotations = false` in `LintConfig`) because
the linter lacks a symbol table and cannot distinguish calls to pure MVL helpers from calls
to effectful stdlib functions. Enabling it opt-in allows teams that enforce
explicit-everywhere annotation density to use it without imposing the requirement on the
entire corpus.
